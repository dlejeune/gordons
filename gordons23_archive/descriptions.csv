The dramatic moment when the victim is pulled from the water and the heart is not beating should be captured with a mix of close-ups and medium shots, emphasizing the urgency and the Scouts' reactions. 

When CPR is initiated, respect the sensitivity of the situation but don't shy away from the intensity of the moment. Capture the compressions, the checking of airways, and the surrounding Scouts' reactions.

Throughout, maintain a focus on the Emergency Scene Management: the prioritization, the decision-making, and the application of first aid techniques. This is not just about the drama, but about showcasing the skill and training of the Scouts in action.
