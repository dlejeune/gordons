Scouts must demonstrate the correct method of retrieving their patrol member, covering the procedures: reach, throw, row, go. Following this, one patrol member must accurately rescue the drowning member. After the rescue, the patrol is required to treat BOTH the victim and the rescuer. When the victim is pulled from the water, you must inform them that their heart is not beating. Inform the rescuer that they are now shivering violently, and have become a secondary patient.\n\n\n\nThe main objective here is to assess Emergency Scene Management (ESM): the 4 H's, triage, correct 112 number called, and proceedure followed. Ensure there's an observation for their approach to the scene, prioritization of actions, and correct application of first aid techniques. CPR must be conducted, and airways must be checked. We suspect a spinal injury due to the head trauma, but it is more important to get the victem out the water as there is a time constraint.\n\n\n\nThe scenario will end once the patrol declares the victem and rescuer stable.\n\n",

In an unfortunate turn of events, the trailing boat accidently crashes into the double in the water, knocking him out cold with major head trauma. Upon seeing this, the director is panicking, and the medics are nowhere in sight. Step in, demonstrate the correct rescue procedure, and make sure both the victim and rescuer are cared for afterwards. The water is becoming dangerous due to the boats moving around.\n\n",

Another camera can capture the wider scene, showcasing the full scope of the rescue effort, and the patrol's coordination.\n\n\n\nThe dramatic moment when the victim is pulled from the water and the heart is not beating should be captured with a mix of close-ups and medium shots, emphasizing the urgency and the Scouts' reactions. \n\n\n\nWhen CPR is initiated, respect the sensitivity of the situation but don't shy away from the intensity of the moment. Capture the compressions, the checking of airways, and the surrounding Scouts' reactions.\n\n\n\nThroughout, maintain a focus on the Emergency Scene Management: the prioritization, the decision-making, and the application of first aid techniques. This is not just about the drama, but about showcasing the skill and training of the Scouts in action.\n\n\n\nEnd with shots of the stabilized victims and a relieved patrol, emphasizing the gravity of what they've just accomplished.

The staff, lined up neatly, represent the culmination of the event's organization, so get sweeping shots of them, highlighting their professionalism and dedication.\n\n\n\nWhen the winning patrols salute the chief judge, be ready for close-ups. The salute, an emblem of respect and honor, is a key moment. The joy, pride, and perhaps even surprise on the winners' faces need to be captured in high resolution.\n\n\n\nThe presentation of the Gordon Shield is the climax. Frame the shot to have the chief judge and the winning team's leader in focus, with the gleaming Gordon Shield taking center stage. Capture the exact moment the shield is handed over \u2014 that's the shot of the day.\n\n\n\nDon't forget the spectators. Their cheers, claps, and perhaps even tears, are integral to the narrative. Their reactions to the announcements provide a rich backdrop to the main event.\n\n\n\nLastly, as the parade concludes, capture the teams' interactions \u2014 the congratulations, the group hugs, the high-fives.
